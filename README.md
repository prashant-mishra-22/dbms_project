 Abstract
 This project implements a secure music streaming platform using MySQL as the primary database
 management system. The system features user authentication, session management, and a responsive
 dashboard interface, providing foundational components for a music recommendation service similar to
 commercial platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.
 1. Introduction
 1.1 Database Management Systems
 A Database Management System (DBMS) serves as software infrastructure enabling users to create,
 manage, and manipulate databases efficiently while ensuring data integrity and security. MySQL was
 selected for this project due to its open-source nature, reliability, performance characteristics, and
 widespread adoption in web development frameworks.
 1.2 Problem Statement
 The project addresses the need for:
 Secure music streaming platform infrastructure
 Robust user authentication and session management
 Efficient music playlist organization
 Comprehensive user profile management
 Foundation for music recommendation algorithms
 2. System Architecture
 2.1 Database Design
 The system implements a relational database schema with the following core table:
2.2 Technology Stack
 Backend: Node.js with Express.js framework
 Database: MySQL 2.x with mysql2 connector
 Security: bcrypt for password hashing, express-session for session management
 Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
 Styling: Custom CSS with modern design principles
 3. System Implementation
 3.1 Authentication System
 The authentication mechanism implements a two-layer security approach:
 1. Client-side validation: Form validation and initial password encryption
 2. Server-side security: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds for password storage
 3.2 Session Management
 Express-session middleware manages user sessions with secure cookie configuration:
 sql
 CREATE CREATE  TABLE TABLE users  users ( (
    id     id INT INT  AUTO_INCREMENT AUTO_INCREMENT  PRIMARY PRIMARY  KEY KEY, ,
    name     name VARCHAR VARCHAR( (255 255) )  NOT NOT  NULL NULL, ,
    email     email VARCHAR VARCHAR( (255 255) )  NOT NOT  NULL NULL  UNIQUE UNIQUE, ,
    password     password VARCHAR VARCHAR( (255 255) )  NOT NOT  NULL NULL, ,
    created_at     created_at TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP  DEFAULT DEFAULT  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
 ) ); ;
 javascript
 // Password hashing implementation // Password hashing implementation
 const const hashedPassword  hashedPassword = =  await await bcrypt bcrypt. .hash hash( (password password, ,  10 10) ); ;
 javascript
 app app. .use use( (session session( ({ {
        secret secret: :  'your-secret-key' 'your-secret-key', ,
        resave resave: :  false false, ,
        saveUninitialized saveUninitialized: :  false false, ,
        cookie cookie: :  { {  secure secure: :  false false  } }
 } }) )) ); ;
3.3 Database Operations
 The system performs essential CRUD operations:
 CREATE: User registration with encrypted credentials
 READ: User authentication and profile retrieval
 UPDATE: Session state management
 DELETE: Session termination on logout
 4. Key Features
 4.1 Security Implementation
 RSA Encryption: Multi-layer password encryption
 Session Validation: Server-side authentication verification
 SQL Injection Prevention: Parameterized queries using prepared statements
 4.2 User Interface Components
 Responsive Registration/Login Pages: Mobile-optimized forms
 Interactive Dashboard: Music-themed interface with playlist management
 Navigation System: Sidebar navigation with user profile integration
 4.3 Music Platform Features
 Search Functionality: Real-time music search capabilities
 Playlist Management: Featured playlists and recommendations
 Media Player Interface: Basic music player controls
 5. Technical Challenges and Solutions
 5.1 Password Encryption Challenge
 Problem: Implementing secure RSA encryption for password storage
 Solution: Implemented two-step encryption process combining client-side hashing with server-side
 bcrypt encryption
 5.2 Session Management Challenge
 Problem: Dashboard loading after successful authentication
 Solution: Implemented endpoint-based routing with session validation middleware
 6. Results and Evaluation
 6.1 Learning Outcomes
Mastery of session management techniques
 Implementation of secure password encryption protocols
 Database design and SQL query optimization
 Full-stack web development with Node.js and MySQL
 6.2 System Performance
 The current implementation successfully handles:
 Secure user registration and authentication
 Session persistence across browser sessions
 Responsive dashboard loading
 Basic music metadata storage and retrieval
 7. Future Enhancements
 7.1 Database Migration
 Migration to PostgreSQL for enhanced performance and advanced features including:
 JSON data type support for complex music metadata
 Advanced indexing capabilities
 Better concurrency handling
 7.2 Scalability Improvements
 Implementation of connection pooling for database optimization
 Redis integration for session storage
 Load balancing for multi-user environments
 Advanced recommendation algorithms using machine learning
 7.3 Feature Expansion
 Real-time music streaming capabilities
 Social features (playlists sharing, user following)
 Advanced search with filters and sorting
 Mobile application development
 8. Conclusion
 This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a secure music recommendation system
 using MySQL as the core database management system. The system provides a solid foundation for user
authentication, session management, and basic music platform functionality. The modular architecture
 supports future enhancements and scalability requirements for production deployment.
 The implementation showcases practical applications of database design principles, web security best
 practices, and modern web development techniques, providing valuable experience in full-stack
 development with MySQL integration.
